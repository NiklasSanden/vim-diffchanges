# vim-diffchanges fork
Original README is empty "README.mkd". Instead, useful information is under doc/

This fork removes the newline added to the unsaved version in :DiffChangesDiffToggle after ":read"ing the file. Also adds a marker (d) that makes you jump back to where you were when you first called :DiffChangesDiffToggle.
